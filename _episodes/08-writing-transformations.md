## Writing transformations

To start writing transformations, select the column on which you wish to perform a transformation and choose ```Edit cells->Transformâ€¦```. In the screen that displays you have a place to write a transformation (the 'Expression' box) and then the ability to Preview the effect the transformation would have on 10 rows of your data.

The transformation you type into the 'Expression' box has to be a valid GREL expression. The simplest expression is simply the word 'value' by itself - which simply means the value that is currently in the column - that is: make no change.

GREL functions are written by giving a value of some kind (a text string, a date, a number etc.) to a GREL function. Some GREL functions take additional parameters or options which control how the function works. GREL supports two types of syntax:

* ```value.function(options)```
* ```function(value, options)```

Either is valid, and which is used is completely down to personal preference. In these notes the first syntax is used.

Next to the 'Preview' option are options to view:

* 'History' - a list of transformations you've previously used with the option to reuse them immediately or to 'star' them for easy access
* 'Starred' - a list of transformations you've 'starred' via the 'History' view
* 'Help' - a list of all the GREL functions and brief information on how to use them

>## Extract city/town information
>Use Facets and the GREL expression ```value.smartSplit(",")[-1]``` to extract town/city data
>1.  Click the dropdown menu on the Place column
>2. Choose ```Edit column->Add column based on this column...```
>3. In the Expression box type ```value.smartSplit(",")[-1]```
>4. In the Preview pane under you can see what the effect of running this will be
>5. Chose a column name
>6. Click ```OK```. Check quality of the data (not bad, but does give us greater sense of geographical spread)
